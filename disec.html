		<p>Dear Delegates,</p>

		<p><small>It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to the 4th edition of LMCMUN and the First Committee of the General Assembly, Disarmament and International Security Committee. I am really looking forward to meeting all of you in May this year. I am Aakash Bhattacharya and it is a great honour to be your chairperson.</p>
		<p>As an 11th grade student in La Martiniere for Boys who loves watching movies, playing cricket and is an avid reader with an interest in world affairs, a Model United Nations conference is more than just an activity for me. It&rsquo;s an event which not only provides you with a platform to discuss various international issues and disputes but also helps you to develop friendships which you may cherish throughout your lifetime.</p>

		<p>My director, Akshay Sharma, is a fellow 11th grade student and a passionate MUNner, an avid
		football fan and a regular in school athletics and various other sporting events including equestrian
		sports. Together, we are undoubtedly the most entertaining duo in the entire secretariat.</p>

		<p>This year, as the chairperson of DISEC, I plan on bringing before you one of the best MUN experiences possible. And for that very reason, I have opted for a topic which will infuse both heated debate and a test of your diplomacy, which are both integral aspects to an MUN.</p>
		<p>The topic for the DISEC this year is &rsquo;Consequences of Foreign Military Bases&rsquo;, a topic having no borders. And I am really eager to watch all of you debate over this interesting topic. As an individual who loves his research, I would urge you to look beyond the realms of your study guide but at the same time, enjoy every bit of the overall experience.</p>

		<p>With regards,</small></p>
		<p>Aakash Bhattacharya</p>
		<p>Chairperson of the Disarmament and International Security Committee</p>

    <h3> Topic Area Summary </h3>
    <h4>Topic: Consequences of foreign military bases.</h4>
<p><small>The overall concept of a sending nation setting up a foreign military base in a host nation is one which is highly interesting. Be it a foreign military base in the terror struck country of Afghanistan or in the advanced, well developed states of South Korea and Germany. Despite their sole aim to better the global scenario and bring about peace and security in the various parts of the world, every base brings with itself various pros and cons. Starting from the very basics of setting up FMBs(Foreign Military Bases), a Status of Forces Agreement signed between a host nation and the sending nation right up to its impacts on both the nations, be it economical, militarial, humanitarian or the likes, this committee aims at discussing FMBs and its consequences.</p>
<p>With every country having its own stance on FMBs, be it Chinaâ€™s non intervention policy or the United States of Americas war on terror and spread of foreign military bases to bring about peace and security, this topic is undoubtedly one of the most globalised topics to discuss. It is to deal with pressing issues such as secret bases in Africa, human rights violations such as rape cases, etc by workers at foreign military bases, violations of Status of Forces Agreements and jurisdictional controversies. At the same time considering the fact that these very military bases are those which stabilize and bring about peace and security in the terror struck regions of Afghanistan and various other Middle Eastern countries trying to bring about stable governments there in the near future.</p>
<p>Dating back to the cold war eras, through the times where the Soviet Union disintegrated into various independent states and the spread of Russian bases to post the 9/11 attacks and the consequent spread of American bases through the middle east till the recent declaration of the Asia Pivot, an American policy which deals with the spread of American influence, bases and troops to the Asia Pacific.
This topic clearly has a vast timeframe.</p>
<p>Given this topic, I am certain that it is going to enable every individual in committee to actively take part and contribute to the fullest of their abilities.</p>
<p>We are clearly looking at a topic without borders.</small></p>
