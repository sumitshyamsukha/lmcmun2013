        <h2>KGB(USSR Secret Service) :</h2>
		<img src="./img/ritika.png" width = 300px height=300px />
		<p>&rsquo;For me, the KGB means fear.&rsquo;</p>
		<p>-Yevgenia Albats, KGB: State Within A State.</p>
		
		<p> Privet delegatam. </p>
		<p><small>Welcome to the most sophisticated, clandestine, and labyrinthine intelligence and security agency the world has ever seen. The Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopastnosti which translates to the Committee for State Security of the Soviet Union or simply, the KGB, has ensconced itself firmly in history as one of the most abstruse and enigmatic yet efficient committees to ever have existed. </p>

		<p> The KGB simulated at LMCMUN 2013 will be chaired by myself; a twelfth grade humanities student, with a decided affinity for the arts. I am an 8th Grade pianist, an ardent debater, a voracious reader, and it goes without saying, heavily involved in Model U.N. Having been a part of several Model U.N. conferences over the past three years, I have always been attracted to the more unconventional specialized committees and ergo; the KGB. <p>

		<p> Your board also comprises of Director Mohona Chaudhuri and Rapporteur Shanika Bhowmick, in classes eleven and ten respectively. Each of them is an accomplished rower and amongst the best MUN-ers in her batch. Mohona&rsquo;s interests also include computers and debating whereas Shanika is a skilled classical dancer and swimmer. Each of us being rather idiosyncratic in her own way, you can be assured that there will not be a monotonous moment in committee. As the saying in the KGB goes, &rsquo;We, are of a different blood&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Delegates, every single one of you has to be exceptionally prepared if you intend to succeed in this committee and as Chair, I have exceedingly high expectations of you; both in terms of quality of debate and impeccability of research of not only your own portfolios, but also those of everyone present in committee. This ought to be coupled with an intrinsic and comprehensive understanding of the personality you will be portraying. I impress upon you the importance of being as realistic and authentic as possible, although vacuous histrionics will not be looked upon favourably. Keep in mind this committee is going to be highly convoluted and extremely fast paced in nature; therefore expeditious handling of situations and crises is incredibly important.</small> </p>



		<p>I look forward to seeing you in May,</p>

		<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

		<p>Ritika Biswas.</p>

		<h3>Topic Area Summary</h3>
		<p><small>The Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti was the Committee for State Security in USSR
that first took form as the Cheka, merely an important military and security arm of the Bolshevik
Communist government, in 1917 under Vladimir Lenin but soon metamorphosed into a
multifaceted organization consisting of sixteen directorates that further comprised of several
agencies. The KGB reached the zenith of its power during the Cold War during which it played a
crucial and decisive role in manipulating and influencing U.S.S.R.-U.S. relations.</p>

<p>The Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti simulated at La Martiniere Calcutta Model
U.N. 2013 will take place in March 1953 onwards and the timeline will end in the late 1950s,
as per the flow of committee. Delegates, please keep in mind the dual role of the KGB both as
a body which dealt with international counter-intelligence and foreign intelligence, specifically
pertaining to the United States, as well as an omniscient power within the Soviet Union itself.</p>

<p>You must have thorough knowledge not only of all sixteen directorates, agencies, the
structure and functions of each but also the history and significant events of the Cold War during
the aforementioned period and in particular, the role of the KGB in moulding history via its
operations, schemes and so on. Since you will each be given a portfolio which may be that of
a Chief Directorate chairperson, an important political personality or perhaps even an spy; it is
absolutely imperative that you delve into your character and are cognizant of your role in the
KGB as well as committee dynamics.</p>

<p>The KGB in LMCMUN 2013 has enormous potential to be the finest committee you have
ever been a part of if you, delegates, embrace this opportunity and utilize it to its fullest extent. I
sincerely hope that you do.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me at ritika5008@yahoo.co.in with any queries whatsoever.</small></p>
