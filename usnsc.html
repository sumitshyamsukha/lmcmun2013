        <h2>United States National Security Council :</h2>
		<img src="./img/ananya.png" width=300px height=300px/>
		<p>Dear delegates,</p>

		<p><small>Welcome to the most powerful committee in the world - the United States National Security Council. It is my distinct pleasure to be the chairperson of this committee at LMCMUN 2013. This year we will be simulating meetings of the USNSC immediately after the calamitous events of September 11, 2001.</small></p>
		<p><small>The USNSC promises to be a highly entertaining and exhilarating experience for both you and for the Executive Board. We hope to take your level of thinking beyond the usual General Assemblies and Security Councils and make it one of your most cherished memories in your MUN career. Being able to think on your feet and putting it across in committee will be an essential criterion when it comes to this committee.</small></p>


		<p><small>Coming to your board, your chair(me) is a student of class 11 and a passionate debater and MUNner. I am a voracious reader, deeply interested in world politics and am heavily into sports, football and cricket being at the top of my list. Your director is Sumit Shyamsukha from class 10. He is a highly talented MUNner and one of the rising stars of La Martiniere in this field. Sumit is a highly conscientious boy, a brilliant researcher, a hard worker and a computer genius who hacks websites in his past time.</small></p>


		<p><small>Enough about us, this committee is more about you and come this May, I hope to see you all putting up a brilliant spectacle. More importantly, I hope you enjoy this conference and your experience here at LMCMUN 2013 in the City of Joy, Kolkata.</small></p>


		<p><small>Yours truly,</small></p>

		<p>Ananya Kumar Nigam,</p>
		<p>Chairperson- United States National Security Council(USNSC)</p>

		<h3> Topic Area Summary </h3>
		<p><small>The United States National Security Council (USNSC) was created in 1947 by the National Security Act under the administration of President Harry Truman. Originally created in light of the escalating tension between the USA and the Soviet Union, this committee’s primary function was to advise the President of U.S.A. on matters regarding national security and foreign policy, and to ensure implementation of these policies by  co-ordinating the various instruments of national security policy. Since then this committee has greatly evolved in puissance and authority, and is today regarded as the Committee that runs the World. As a committee that has the authority to authorize the killing of any US citizen, this committee enjoys a great degree of extralegal authority along with the tremendous amount of power it already wields. </p>

<p>The committee is going to be chaired by the President (Me) and the Vice President (Sumit) and comprises the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, Director of the CIA and other statutory and non-statutory members of whom you shall be informed in greater detail in the Study Guide. You, as delegates, will be representing members of this committee.</p>

<p>This committee will be meeting right after the disastrous attacks of 9/11 and you, as the leaders of this great State, must step up and deliver. These are indeed testing times. Delegates understand that you are a part of the most powerful committee of the most powerful country of the world. A country that has been plagued by strife, upheaval and outright anarchy by the recent devastating attacks. As a member of this committee, you must not only address the situation in your own country internally, but also take a stance on foreign policy and the United States reaction to an attack of such magnitude. The twin towers, which have long been a symbol of America and its wealth, as well as a symbol of capitalism, have been demolished by an act of terrorism. Your country, your people depend you to act on their behalf. Having been plunged into a state of shock and insecurity, they expect you to respond; to deal with this situation in a way that will guarantee the people their security while showing the world that an attack on the most powerful country in the world will not go unanswered. The perpetrators must be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Coming to research for this committee, it is imperative to know American foreign and internal policy thoroughly, as of September 2001, and also to have an idea of American military bases and budget. Be aware of the exact functions and workings of the USNSC, the procedure with which decisions are made, and how they are ultimately implemented. All this of course, will be discussed at greater length in the Study Guide. We will try to provide you with extensive information and research sources which might make researching on such an intricate committee slightly easier for you.</small></p>
