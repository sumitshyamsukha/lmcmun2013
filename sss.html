		<img src="./img/rishabh.png" width=300px height=300px/>
		<p>Dear Delegates,</p>


		<p><small>I am indescribably excited to welcome you all to the Special Summit on Syria(SSS) of La Martiniere Calcutta Model United Nations 2013! To the seasoned Model UN veterans amongst you all I hope LMCMUN 2013 will be an academically challenging experience for you and the Special Summit on Syria will be one of your most enlightening experiences so far and to all those and to all those newcomers I am honoured to be the one to welcome you to this thought-provoking style of debate. Up until and right throughout the conference I will be there beside you to try and make LMCMUN 2013 and unforgettable experience.</small></p>


		<p><small>Now to introduce myself, I am a class 11 student pursuing commerce and I plan on concentrating on Criminal Law in the future. My hobbies include debating , reading up on political issues and so on and I also enjoy playing football , tennis and like pretty much every other Indian , cricket. However to be perfectly honest with you I am the farthest thing from an artistic person you&rsquo;ll ever meet since I can&rsquo;t sing or dance to save my life!</small></p>

		<p><small>As LMCMUN 2013 slowly but surely approaches I hope that you all are excited to delve into diplomatic business as we have a thrilling topic lined up for you! This topic encompasses the global phenomena that is the Arab Spring and it will force you as delegates to once again look into the impact of this colossal revolution and debate the right to intervention in this scenario.</small></p>

		<p><small>Delegates as this is a contantly evolving topic , I would urge you to look for sources beyond the study guide I prepare for you as well as online articles because it is highly likely that the situation will be very different in a few month&rsquo;s time . I would also urge you to examine the deeper philosophical questions concerning this inter- national conflict. I am confident that our committee will be the best at this confer- ence not only because of the quality of debate but also the quality of the delegates! If you have any concerns or questions(which I am sure you will) please feel free to contact me via phone or e-mail.I absolutely cannot wait to meet you all and I can&rsquo;t wait to make what i am sure will be unforgettable memories at LMCMUN 2013!</small></p>

    <h3>Topic: Syrian Crisis</h3>
<p><small>I am sure all of you are aware of the revolutionary Arab Spring which has changed the face of the middle east. Across middle eastern countries tyrannical dictators have been overthrown to setup democratic governments. However, in Syria, the situation remain unique as the president of 13 years , Bashar-Al-Assad , is still in power. Since 1971 , Syria has been ruled by the Assad family, first by the powerful ex-military officer , Hafiz-Al-Assad , who was succeeded by his son Bashar in 2000 after his death.The ruling party in Syria presently, the Ba’ath party was formed in 1947 and throughout the late 1940s and the entire 1950s the Ba’th party grew in power as Syria went through a number of changes in government due to military coups. But  it was in 1963 that the Ba’th party formally came to power after yet another military coup. A decade later , the constitution of Syria was adopted which ,amongst other things , stated that the President must be a muslim(which was later removed leading to public outcry) and that The National Progressive Front(the alliance led by the Ba’ath party) would have 167 out of 250 seats reserved for itself in the National Legislative Council. </p>
<p>Syria has technically been at war with Israel since 1963 when the state of emergency was imposed which lasted 48 years.There have also been volatile relations between Syria and countries like Iraq , Iran ,Egypt ,Jordan , United States of America and Russia.
More recently a number of rebel groups have emerged , all of whom have varying demands. Whereas some want  democratic reforms , some want a change in leadership but the same system of government but there are also groups that want Assad to continue as President but just to mend his ways.
Also , due to the Assad leadership and rumoured ties of the Syrian government to known terrorist organizations , the United States of America along with the European Union have imposed harsh sanctions on Syria thereby crippling its economy.</p>
<p>As a result of growing instability and violence two resolutions have been tabled in the UNSC stating that the UN will intervene in Syria but both these resolutions have been vetoed by Russia and China.</p>
<p>As you can see Syria has multiple complex issues to deal with which affect not only Syria itself but also the global community as a whole due to volatility and gravity of the situation. So, as delegates it will be your job to decide what the next step of the UN should be.You will have to answer a number of tough questions like: Should the UN intervene in Syria or is Russia and China’s policy of non-intervention justified? As a result this committee will, to say the least , pose a massive challenge to its delegates. However I am confident by the third day of the conference we will be able to solve this colossal crisis.</small></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
</p>Rishabh Bajoria</p>
