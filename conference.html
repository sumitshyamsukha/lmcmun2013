        <h1>Secretary General's Address :</h1>
        <p class="lead">“More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.” - Kofi Annan </p>
        <p>Dear delegates,</p>

        <p>It is my utmost privilege to welcome you to the fourth session of the La Martiniere Calcutta Model United Nations. LMCMUN 2013 is scheduled to take place over three days, from the 18th - 20th of May 2013. After 3 hugely successful conferences LMCMUN 2013 is the biggest one yet, boasting of six diverse committees and over 300 delegates from across the country and abroad. We at La Martiniere are assiduously working towards making this conference insurmountable in every respect, and I can assure you that you have been placed in the hands of a very capable Secretariat that wants nothing more than to ensure an amazing experience for each one of you.</p>

        <p>The United Nations is the foremost body for maintaining peace and security in our discordant, conflict-ridden world. Now more than ever, at a time when almost every nation has access to nuclear weapons, the UN’s mediation and perspicacity is required to maintain harmony among nations and preclude disasters of prodigious proportions. With the official recognition of Palestinian statehood, the financial crisis in Europe, and the USA’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, the dynamics of world politics are mercurial, and the relevance of the UN cannot, for even one second, be undermined.</p>

        <p>Model United Nations is an activity that has ferociously gained popularity, especially in India, over the past few years. Our school instantaneously took to it, attending conferences across India and even abroad, to the extent that we hosted the first ever Model United Nations conference in East India, LMCMUN 2009. Simulating various committees of the UN as well as other governmental and non-state actors, Model United Nations offers delegates with a very demanding form of debate. Delegates must display virtuosity in the art of negotiation and deliberation, while simultaneously being intransigent with their respective country’s policies. This they must do keeping the ultimate goal of international peace and security, the primary objective of the United Nations, in mind as they work constructively with other delegates.</p>

        <p>This year LMCMUN has six very challenging committees which will test delegates to the limits of their abilities. With 3 conventional committees, 2 specialized agencies and a special summit, this conference offers a geopolitically eclectic ensemble of agendas where delegates will be required to debate topics ranging from the situation in the United States of America post 9/11, to the covert operations of the Russian Secret Service, and even the tumultuous situation prevalent in the state of Syria. </p>

       <p>Delegates, I cannot express enough how exhilarated I am about this conference, and I can only hope you share this sentiment. We look forward to seeing you at a very highly anticipated LMCMUN 2013 and hope you have an unparalleled experience. Please feel free to contact any member of the Secretariat - the board or the administrative team - with any queries you might have regarding our conference. I once again welcome you to La Martiniere and LMCMUN, and to those of you who are attending our conference from outside the city, we hope you have an enjoyable stay.</p>

      <p>Remember, delegates, with great power comes great responsibility. The fate of the world is in your hands. This is your symphony, and the world is your orchestra.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>Yamir Tainwala</p>
    <p>Secretary-General</p>
    <p>La Martiniere Calcutta Model United Nations 2013. </p>
